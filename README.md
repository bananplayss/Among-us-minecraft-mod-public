# Impostor special abilities
**If you've crafted a TNT from the impostor items spawning on the map randomly (trident, sand, gunpowder, spyglass, etc), you can blow up a TNT which kills players in a radius.
Piglin army spawns a bunch of piglings targeting the nearest player. They will rush down the player and assassinate them.
Speed is self explanatory, so is invisibility.
Phantom places a phantom onto the nearest target givingthem 30 seconds to live. When the timer runs out, they die. Other crewmates can use their save ability which is a 50% chance they succeed. If they do, both players survive and the phantom is destroyed, if not, the saviour dies.
The ender pearl ability lets you teleport you where you would like on the map. Just click a place and you're there.**

Note: The commission was to make a lookalike seeing SSundee's older video on the topic, but I ended up making some things a little more differently.
